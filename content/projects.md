* Built mixnet in C using Spanning Tree Protocol, using shortest-path algorithm
  to optimize for latency
* Performed TCP handshakes and implemented TCP Reno algorithm for congestion
  control
* Utilized Berkeley socket API to send HTTP requests via pipelining and parallel
  connections

### C0 Compiler
