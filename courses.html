  <h1>Courses I've Taken</h1>

  <h2>A compilation of the courses I've taken at CMU</h2>

  <p>
    I've seen a number of CMU students write about their courses, so I'd thought
    I'd do the same. For some context, I came to CMU with the intention of
    majoring in Physics, which explains the many science classes that I took as
    well as my lack of programming and formal math experience.

  <h3>Summer 2023</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        15-213 Introduction to Computer Systems
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        70-311 Organizational Behavior
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Spring 2023</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        15-210 Parallel and Sequential Data Structures and Algorithms (?)
      </p>
      <p>
        This was the course meant to be the standard “algorithms course”, with a
        lot of focus on parallelism. Homeworks and exams were brutal, but the
        course material was pretty interesting, as it built a lot on the
        material from previous CS courses. Other than its lack of structure, it
        was a pretty good course in teaching algorithmic thinking (which was
        surprisingly useful for leetcode).
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
      15-251 Great Ideas in Theoretical Computer Science (?)
      </p>
      <p>
        This course ended up eating up a large portion of my weeks (did weekly
        homeworks Sunday night to Wednesday night). Homework was brutal, but the
        course felt structured in a way that worked for the students to succeed.
        I felt like this course was the most I had learned from thus far, which
        was nice to see given how much time it took me.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        33-232 Mathematical Methods of Physics
      </p>
      <p>
        A course meant to prepare physics students for the math in junior-level
        physics courses. Luckily, I had essentially covered most of the math
        that I needed from 21-241 and 21-259. As it turns out though, taking a
        surface integral will never be not challenging.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        76-270 Writing for the Professions
      </p>
      <p>
        A pretty typical writing course. It's known as the “resume class”, but
        there's also a lot of focus on writing in a manner that allows readers
        to “satisfice”, which was pretty useful to learn about.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        38-230 ENGAGE in Wellness: Looking Inward
      </p>
      <p>
        To demonstrate my improvement in overall wellness, I wrote a 5-page
        essay talking about my crippling addiction to Wordle.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>33-202 Physics Sophomore Colloquium II</p></li>
    <p>
      <strong>Reflections:</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, a semester with a lot of work, but came out of it feeling
      somewhat accomplished. Courses, as well as TAing and CS Academy took up a
      lot of time, but I think I was able to manage my time better relative to
      previous semesters. Plus, I enjoyed the actual content in my courses,
      which gave me a lot more motivation.
    </p>
  </ul>

  <h3>Fall 2022</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        33-211 Physics III: Modern Essentials (?)
      </p>
      <p>
        Painful. Homework was due four times a week, which made it feel like I
        was working on this class all the time. Exams were also pretty brutal.
        As it turns out, reasoning about special relativity and basic quantum
        theory is…unintuitive, to say the least. I wasn't quite sure how much I
        actually got out of this course, and it also made me realize that I
        definitely wasn't looking forward to taking Quantum Mechanics, or any
        junior-level physics class for that matter.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        33-231 Physical Analysis
      </p>
      <p>
        Differential equations for the Physics students. I really enjoyed the
        way that it was taught. Due to the fact that it was for physics majors,
        there was a much larger focus on how differential equations applied to
        physics and less about the rigorous proofs behind why the math worked. I
        initially wanted to do physics due to the pretty relationship between
        calculus and introductory mechanics, so having another tool to expand my
        vocabulary of ways to describe physical systems was cool.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        33-241 Introduction to Computational Physics (!)
      </p>
      <p>
        This course was effectively “applied numerical methods”, with its
        motivation being physics. We were able to model some very interesting
        systems in this course using numpy and matplotlib (Python packages). My
        only qualm was that I wish I had taken this course as a junior rather
        than a sophomore. Some of the math (Fourier transforms and probability
        distributions) and physics (quantum mechanics) I hadn't seen yet, which
        made the course significantly harder than it probably should have been. 
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        09-105 Introduction to Modern Chemistry I
      </p>
      <p>
        A pretty easy course. I mainly relied on my knowledge from AP Chemistry
        to get through it.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        82-137 Chinese Calligraphy: Culture and Skills
      </p>
      <p>
        A super laid-back course. I probably would've enjoyed this course way
        more in a less strenuous semester (as it turns out, thinking about
        physics while trying to write Chinese characters wasn't very relaxing).
      </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>99-250 Seminar for Peer Mentors</p></li>
    <li><p>33-201 Physics Sophomore Colloquium I</p></li>
    <p>
      <strong>Reflections:</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      This course load was brutal for a number of reasons. Trying to balance my
      courses with work with CMU CS Academy and as an SI Leader was difficult.
      More importantly, I didn't enjoy many of the courses I was taking this
      semester. This semester was sort of the “last chance” for physics, and I
      was pretty certain that I was about ready to try and switch majors. 
    </p>
  </ul>

  <h3>Summer 2022</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        15-122 Principles of Imperative Computation (!)
      </p>
      <p>
        The typical “data structures” course. 15-122 does a nice job of
        introducing the data structures that I would need to know, as well as
        being able to reason about the correctness and safety of imperative
        programs. I also got way better at debugging in this course due to
        having to reason about memory. The course was a lot of work during the
        summer (30-40 hours a week), but I don't regret taking it. Overall, I
        felt like a way better programmer as a result.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        15-150 Principles of Functional Programming (!?)
      </p>
      <p>
        This was (and will likely continue to be) my favorite course at CMU.
        Being able to write recursive code and prove its correctness via
        inductive reasoning was such a tricky concept to initially understand,
        but getting past that initial barrier made the experience feel extremely
        worth it. 15-150 highlights the beauty of abstraction in code, which was
        a unique way of thinking. To me, functional programming highlighted a
        “beauty” of computer science, similar to how other disciplines such as
        physics or math can also be “beautiful” at times. λ Functions are values
        λ!

      Honestly, I had a lot of fun this summer. I wasn't so bogged down by other
      commitments, so I was mainly able to just focus on classes and work for
      CMU CS Academy. Taking 15-122 and 15-150 simultaneously was also an
      interesting experience—it highlighted two drastically different ways to
      reason about programs. I ended up feeling a bit sick of programming by the
      end of the summer, and was sort of looking forward to taking some courses
      that were less coding intensive.
    </p>
  </ul>

  <h3>Spring 2022</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        15-112 Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science (!)
      </p>
      <p>
        Probably the most well-known course at CMU, 15-112 definitely lives up
        to its name. I went into the course having no knowledge of how to
        program and came out with a full-fledged project in Python (though I'm
        not particularly proud of it…maybe I can go back and add more to it at
        some point). The algorithmic thinking that I learned was incredibly
        valuable for later courses that I would take.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        21-127 Concepts of Mathematics (?)
      </p>
      <p>
        The typical “introduction to discrete mathematics + other topics”
        course. 21-127 ended up being really hard for me. I hadn't written a
        mathematical proof before taking this course, so I struggled figuring
        out how to formalize my ideas. Also, finding the idea for some of the
        homework problems was brutal. Looking back, however, this was probably
        due to me just staring at most problems, rather than writing out
        different ideas and seeing where they led. This course gave me some
        basic knowledge in formalizing mathematics, which ended up being useful
        for a lot of other courses.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        21-241 Matrices and Linear Transformations (?)
      </p>
      <p>
        This course was brutal. For some reason, the proofs that you were
        expected to write in this course ended up being more difficult than the
        ones with 21-127 (the class that's meant to teach you how to write
        proofs). Most of the material went way over the head, but by the end, I
        had a high-level understanding of the basic concepts of linear algebra.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        33-152 Matter and Interactions II (?)
      </p>
      <p>
        Physics 2 for Physics majors. This course ended up being challenging,
        due to its assumption in being fluent in vector calculus and also mixing
        in a bit of linear algebra and probability. I came out of this course
        realizing that I disliked E&M and was probably in the wrong major.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        33-104 Experimental Physics
      </p>
      <p>
        A laid-back and a bit of a tedious course. I learned some basic Excel to
        optimize doing calculations, which was probably useful.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        57-299 Bagpipe and Drum Band
      </p>
      <p>
        Fun! It was nice having a “required” commitment that wasn't purely
        academic. Practices being at Monday 7pm - 9pm was tiring though.
      </p>

        This semester was intense for me. I greatly underestimated how much time
        some of these courses would take (especially the math courses). It was
        around this time that I realized that I probably wasn't going to be too
        happy as a Physics major, so I started looking into other majors, like
        CS or ECE.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Fall 2021</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        21-259 Calculus in Three Dimensions
      </p>
      <p>
        A useful course to learn the basics of vector calculus. Looking back, I
        do wish that this course was a little more rigorous, as most theorems
        were stated without being proved. As it turned out, my retention rate
        for this course ended up being quite poor.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        33-151 Matter and Interactions 1
      </p>
      <p>
        Physics 1 for Physics majors. A bit boring, given that I took
        introductory physics in high school. This course had a final project
        with a computational portion using Jupyter notebook, which I had a lot
        of fun working on.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        76-101 Interpretation and Argument
      </p>
      <p>
        The typical “first-year writing” course that all CMU students need to
        take. This course ended up being surprisingly easy. I somewhat wish that
        I received more feedback, as I didn't come out of course feeling as
        though my writing skills had improved.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        03-121 Modern Biology
      </p>
      <p>
        Didn't get anything out of this course for a number of reasons.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        21-295 Putnam Seminar
      </p>
      <p>
        A laid-back course to help students prepare for Putnam. This course
        ended up being pretty useless for me, as I didn't have any mathematical
        competition experience prior to taking it.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        38-101 EUREKA!: Discovery and Its Impact
      </p>
      <p>
        The “introduction to college class” for the science students at CMU. 
      </p>
    </li>
      <p>
        <strong>Reflections:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, this ended up being a pretty relaxed semester. I had the
        opportunity to make friends and get involved with a few
        extracurriculars, which was pretty nice. Looking back, it might've been
        nice to drop Putnam Seminar and replace it with a more involved course.
